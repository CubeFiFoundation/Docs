# Add and remove liquidity

You can provide liquidity to traders by adding tokens to the liquidity pool

When you add tokens to the liquidity pool, you will receive liquidity pool tokens (LP).

For example, if you deposit CFI and USDT into the liquidity pool, you will receive CFI-USDT LP tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your share in the DSG-BUSD liquidity pool, and you can withdraw your money at any time by removing liquidity.



In order to make your LP to gain more value in addition to trade fees, you can also invest LP tokens into Farm.
